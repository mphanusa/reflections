Today we learned about how to add a remote connection to github.  It involved:
1) create a new github account and sign in
2) create a new respository on git hub.  From there you get a https url that you can use
3) change your local directory to the directory that you want to push to github
4) In git bash, enter: git remote add origin https: ....
5) This establishes a link between your local directory and github repository
6) git push origin master: push the local master branch to the origin repository on github

You want to use a remote repository to share and collaborate your work.
